# 🏦 ATM Management System (Python – OOPS)

## 📌 Project Overview
The **ATM Management System** is a console-based Python application developed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)** concepts.  
It simulates basic ATM operations such as checking balance, depositing money, withdrawing money, and viewing account details.

This project helps in understanding how real-world banking systems can be modeled using classes, objects, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism.

## 🎯 Objectives
- To understand and implement **OOPS concepts in Python**
- To simulate real-time ATM functionality
- To improve logical thinking and program structure
- To build a beginner-friendly mini project

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python 3
- **Concepts:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)
- **Environment:** Terminal / Command Prompt
